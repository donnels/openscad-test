==== VacuumPreAmplifierBase - 3D Object


housing a retro vacuum tube china preamp.
Have a nice wooden box that is looking for some use as a housing The pre-amp is a cheap vaccum tube type sourced from aliexpress https://a.aliexpress.com/_B0MVMZ
I've created an openscad model of the Box based on some measurments with a calliper. The model is designed to help asses where to drill holes and to print a guide to drill the holes. The preamp has a power input (12v~) an in and an output (headphone jack) and a Volume potentiometer. Also the housing is to expose the Vacuum Tubes to the interested viewer. Since the lid is hinged and the relative position of the tubes to the lid, when opening, is difficult to eyeball the model was created to try out different Hole placments as well as providing a template for Drill guides.

=== Howth-cieling-spots - Project


The spots for the ceiling in Howth needed replacing and the replacement spots had a few millimeters too little radius so that they didn't cover the hole properly in all places.
The lamp ring was a quick fix that turned out quite well and looks good.


==== lampRing - 3D Object


This object is not very complex and it's really just a few cylinders laid on top of one another with a few holes cut out for the lamp.

=== desk - Project




==== fastener - 3D Object

This is a fastener for a writing Desk.
The idea is to add a magnet to hold it up and to print it so that it does not require a bearing.

* V1 is the first prototype for a first print test and fitting test
** fits well and axle didn't print free so need update
** The reason was that the axle required supports winside the part to build
** Changed the axle to 45 degree angles to negate the need for supports
* V2 added a better axle but didn't get printed
* V3 added a better cutout and is printed
** The cutout is currently a dummy pending getting the axle to work to try it out with magnets taped into place
** axle prints freely so moving on to screw holes, magnets, and covers
* V4 Added final OCD logo and screw caps etc.
** Mounted and working.
