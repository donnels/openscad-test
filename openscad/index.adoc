==== VacuumPreAmplifierBase - 3D Object


housing a retro vacuum tube china preamp.
Have a nice wooden box that is looking for some use as a housing The pre-amp is a cheap vaccum tube type sourced from aliexpress https://a.aliexpress.com/_B0MVMZ
I've created an openscad model of the Box based on some measurments with a calliper. The model is designed to help asses where to drill holes and to print a guide to drill the holes. The preamp has a power input (12v~) an in and an output (headphone jack) and a Volume potentiometer. Also the housing is to expose the Vacuum Tubes to the interested viewer. Since the lid is hinged and the relative position of the tubes to the lid, when opening, is difficult to eyeball the model was created to try out different Hole placments as well as providing a template for Drill guides.

=== Howth-cieling-spots - Project


The spots for the ceiling in Howth needed replacing and the replacement spots had a few millimeters too little radius so that they didn't cover the hole properly in all places.
The lamp ring was a quick fix that turned out quite well and looks good.


==== lampRing - 3D Object


This object is not very complex and it's really just a few cylinders laid on top of one another with a few holes cut out for the lamp.

=== desk - Project




==== fastener - 3D Object

This is a fastener for a writing Desk.
The idea is to add a magnet to hold it up and to print it so that it does not require a bearing.

* V1 is the first prototype for a first print test and fitting test
** fits well and axle didn't print free so need update
** The reason was that the axle required supports winside the part to build
** Changed the axle to 45 degree angles to negate the need for supports
* V2 added a better axle but didn't get printed
* V3 added a better cutout and is printed
** The cutout is currently a dummy pending getting the axle to work to try it out with magnets taped into place
** axle prints freely so moving on to screw holes, magnets, and covers
* V4 Added final OCD logo and screw caps etc.
** Mounted and working.

=== openai - Project

I decided to have a go to see where openAI's chatGPT has its limits.
And it does have limits.
It's intersting to see that while it seems to know what an object might consist of it has a very hard time making the onject in any way accurate.
In any case it's Interesting.


==== esp8266case-chatgpt - 3D Object

This one is also interesting in that it does some difference etc but it's really not a model of a case.
It looks like it get's the basic premise of subtracting one thing from another etc.
On the other hand it doesn't seem to have a clue about dimensions.
Either way an interesting experimt which shows up the limitations of GPT models.

==== solar-generator-chatgpt - 3D Object

This is also an interesting experiment.
I asked chatGPT to make a solar generator openscad model and this came out.
On the other hand it seems to be good at figuring out what should be part of a solar generator.
I'll have to take closer look of what it did here and how hard it is to fix it.
This could be promising in total but right now it more or less seems to have hit a brick wall that seems to relate to dimensions etc.
In other words it's good at creating a structure but not so good at understanding the physics of what it made.

This is for a plastic play "Katana" sword to make it more like a "One Piece" "Gryphon" sword.
The tiff files are the original sword cross guard from both sides so as to extrude the mounting holes for the handle and the sword.
The idea is to go from scanner to tiff.
Then from tiff to SVG.
Then from SVG to STL.
Then in openscad to subtract te shapes from the crossguard and to send it off to Cura and then to octoprint.
