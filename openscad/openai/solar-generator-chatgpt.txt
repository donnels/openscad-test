This is also an interesting experiment.
I asked chatGPT to make a solar generator openscad model and this came out.
On the other hand it seems to be good at figuring out what should be part of a solar generator.
I'll have to take closer look of what it did here and how hard it is to fix it.
This could be promising in total but right now it more or less seems to have hit a brick wall that seems to relate to dimensions etc.
In other words it's good at creating a structure but not so good at understanding the physics of what it made.
