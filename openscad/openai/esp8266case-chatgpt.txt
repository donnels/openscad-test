This one is also interesting in that it does some difference etc but it's really not a model of a case.
It looks like it get's the basic premise of subtracting one thing from another etc.
On the other hand it doesn't seem to have a clue about dimensions.
Either way an interesting experimt which shows up the limitations of GPT models.
