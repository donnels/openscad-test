This is for a plastic play "Katana" sword to make it more like a "One Piece" "Gryphon" sword.
The tiff files are the original sword cross guard from both sides so as to extrude the mounting holes for the handle and the sword.
The idea is to go from scanner to tiff.
Then from tiff to SVG.
Then from SVG to STL.
Then in openscad to subtract te shapes from the crossguard and to send it off to Cura and then to octoprint.
