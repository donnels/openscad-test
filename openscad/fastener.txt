This is a fastener for a writing Desk.
The idea is to add a magnet to hold it up and to print it so that it does not require a bearing.

* V1 is the first prototype for a first print test and fitting test
** fits well and axle didn't print free so need update
* V2 added a better axle but didn't get printed
* V3 added a better cutout and is being printed
** The cutout is currently a dummy pending getting the axle to work to try it out with magnets taped into place
